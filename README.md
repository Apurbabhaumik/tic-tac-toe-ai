## ⚙️ How It Works

### 🎯 Minimax Algorithm (Unbeatable AI)
- The AI simulates **every possible game outcome** using recursion.
- Chooses the move that leads to the **best guaranteed result**.
- Uses **backtracking** to undo and explore all options.

### 🧪 Game Logic
- 3x3 board stored as an array
- Win/tie conditions checked after every move
- First move: Human → Then AI responds using Minimax
